This README contains my thoughts about the original given code. After thoroughly reviewing the codebase, 
I identified several key areas where improvements can be made to enhance both the structure and maintainability of the project.

1. Dependency Injection
Currently, database tables are queried directly throughout the code whenever needed. Instead, 
I would implement Dependency Injection by injecting the Service layer into the controllers. 
This service layer would then interact with the repository, which is responsible for querying the database. 
By making this change, I would decouple the code, making it more modular and easier to test.

2. Controller and Repository Responsibilities
In the current setup, both the BookingController and BookingRepository seem to handle multiple unrelated responsibilities, 
such as fetching jobs and sending notifications. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle. 
I believe the controller should strictly focus on handling HTTP requests and responses, while any business logic should be 
managed by a service layer.

Moreover, the repository is used to query multiple tables, leading to redundant code. I would refactor the repository, 
consolidating similar queries into reusable methods to reduce repetition and make the code cleaner. Notification-related 
logic within the BookingController should also be separated into a NotificationController to isolate functionality.

3. Removing Unused Methods
There are several methods in the BookingRepository that are not being used. After reviewing their relevance, I would 
remove these unused methods to declutter the code and ensure it only contains the necessary functionality. 
This cleanup would streamline the repository, and Iâ€™d ensure any redundant methods are not needed in the future.

4. Refactoring the BookingRepository
The BookingRepository also contains some bulky methods that could be broken down into smaller, more manageable ones. 
This would increase readability and make the repository easier to maintain in the long run. Additionally, I would create dedicated 
Service and Repository layers for different database models, such as User, Job, and Translator, to further improve separation of concerns.

5. Magic Strings and Hard-Coded Values
I noticed several hard-coded values throughout the code, such as env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID'), env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID'). These magic strings can decrease
the maintainability of the code and increase the risk of errors. I would replace these with constants defined centrally, which would 
improve both readability and the flexibility to change these values in one place across the application.

6. Unclear Naming Conventions
One of the main issues I noticed is the inconsistent and unclear naming conventions. In some cases variables names are in camel case and sometimes they
include underscores. This makes it harder to follow the code, especially for someone unfamiliar with the project. Improving the naming conventions to 
follow best practices, such as using descriptive names would make the code much more readable and easier to maintain.

7. Helper and its usage:
The codebase as one Helper file, placed in the "tests" directory which is being used everywhere to call common methods. For the sake of this
project (since I have not been asked to refactor that file), I would create a new Helper file in the refactor(main) directory and keep the common
methods in that. This way I won't be accessing the "tests" folder files in my main logic of the code.

8. Replacing Request with FormRequest Types
Currently, the controller is directly using the Request object for handling input, which can lead to cluttered code and less structured 
validation. I would replace the Request being used in the controller with specific FormRequest types, such as JobRequest, UserRequest, etc., 
*if the structure of the models is already provided*. By doing this, I would remove the validation logic from the repository, making it a lot
cleaner as well.
Each FormRequest would handle the validation rules specific to that entity, allowing for better maintainability and a more declarative
approach to request validation. 


What I liked about the codebase:

The code is relatively modular, with a dedicated repository handling most of the heavy logic. This abstraction is a good step towards separating concerns.
Use of namespaces is consistent and ensures proper organization of the code.

The use of Laravel's features like Request objects and response handling (response()) is efficient. The repository pattern adds a layer of abstraction 
for database interactions, which is a good practice for large-scale apps.

The code attempts to follow the SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility, by using a repository to handle database queries and business logic.
